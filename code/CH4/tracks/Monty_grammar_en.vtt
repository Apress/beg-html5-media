5
00:00:21.643 --> 00:00:25.400
But today even most cheap home PCs have the processor power and

6
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.092
storage necessary to really toss raw video around,

7
00:00:28.092 --> 00:00:30.479
at least without too much of a struggle. 

8
00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:33.579
So now that everyone has all of this cheap capable hardware, 

9
00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.651
more people, not surprisingly, want to do interesting

10
00:00:36.651 --> 00:00:39.908
things with digital media, especially streaming. 

11
00:00:39.908 --> 00:00:44.017
YouTube was the first huge success, and now everybody wants in.

12
00:00:44.017 --> 00:00:47.413
Well good!  Because this stuff is a lot of fun!

13
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.179
It's no problem finding consumers for digital media.  

14
00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:54.649
But here, I'd like to address the engineers, the mathematicians, 

15
00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.869
the hackers, the people who are interested in discovering 

16
00:00:57.869 --> 00:01:01.302
and making things and building the technology itself. 

17
00:01:01.302 --> 00:01:03.282
The people after my own heart.

18
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.723
Digital media, compression especially, is perceived to be super-elite,

19
00:01:08.723 --> 00:01:12.822
somehow incredibly more difficult than anything else in computer science. 

20
00:01:12.822 --> 00:01:15.700
The big industry players in the field don't mind this perception at all; 

21
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.734
it helps justify the staggering number of very basic patents they hold.  

22
00:01:19.734 --> 00:01:23.870
They like the image that their media researchers are the best of the best, 

23
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.738
so much smarter than anyone else that their brilliant ideas can't 

24
00:01:27.738 --> 00:01:29.903
even be understood by mere mortals. 

25
00:01:30.625 --> 00:01:33.716
This is bunk.  

26
00:01:35.205 --> 00:01:38.900
Digital audio and video and streaming and compression 

27
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.738
offer endless deep and stimulating mental challenges, 

28
00:01:42.738 --> 00:01:44.662
just like any other discipline. 

29
00:01:44.662 --> 00:01:47.929
It seems elite because so few people have been been involved.  

30
00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:51.223
So few people have been involved perhaps because so few people 

31
00:01:51.223 --> 00:01:54.665
could afford the expensive, special-purpose equipment it required. 

32
00:01:54.665 --> 00:01:58.792
But today, just about anyone watching this video has a cheap, 

33
00:01:58.792 --> 00:02:03.317
general-purpose computer powerful enough to play with the big boys. 

34
00:02:05.926 --> 00:02:11.108
There are battles going on today around HTML5 and browsers 

35
00:02:11.108 --> 00:02:13.671
and video and open vs. closed. 

36
00:02:13.671 --> 00:02:17.048
So now is a pretty good time to get involved.  

37
00:02:17.048 --> 00:02:20.000
The easiest place to start is probably understanding 

38
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.619
the technology we have right now.

39
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.071
This is an introduction. 

40
00:02:25.071 --> 00:02:28.180
Since it's an introduction, it glosses over a ton of details 

41
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.882
so that the big picture's a little easier to see.

42
00:02:30.882 --> 00:02:33.908
Quite a few people watching are going to be way past anything 

43
00:02:33.908 --> 00:02:36.378
that I'm talking about, at least for now.  

44
00:02:36.378 --> 00:02:39.293
On the other hand, I'm probably going to go too fast for folks 

45
00:02:39.293 --> 00:02:44.558
who really are are brand new to all of this, so if this is all new, relax. 

46
00:02:44.558 --> 00:02:48.629
The important thing is to pick out any ideas  that really grab your imagination.

47
00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:52.497
Especially pay attention to the terminology surrounding those ideas, 

48
00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:56.078
because with those, and Google, and Wikipedia, you can dig 

49
00:02:56.078 --> 00:02:57.753
as deep as interests you.

50
00:02:57.753 --> 00:03:00.094
So, without any further ado, 

51
00:03:00.094 --> 00:03:03.351
welcome to one hell of a new hobby.
